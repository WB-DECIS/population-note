    "text": "1.1 Population\nPopulation refers to the total number of alive people in a specific area, such as an economy. It can also refer to the number of people in a specific age group, or by sex. Population are also defined by a reference time period. For annual population estimates, the most commonly used reference times include the beginning of the year (January 1st), the mid-year (July 1st or June 30th), or the end of the year (December 31st). Annual population estimates can also be defined as the average number of people in an area over the year, which is typically close to the mid-year population estimate.\nPopulation censuses, the official counting of population within the territory of an economy, play a critical role in producing population estimates. Most economies conduct a population census at least once every ten years. Typically, population estimates after a census (postcensal estimates) are calculated by using the population data from the census as a base, and then by adding births, subtracting deaths, and adding net migration using empirical data. In the calculation, the census data should be adjusted for coverage error such as under- (or over-) counts, as well as for a reference time of the year. When a subsequent census is conducted, intercensal estimates can be produced by adjusting the postcensal estimates.\nAs opposed to the population estimates, population projections are calculated by using future assumptions of births, deaths, and migration subsequent to the latest year of estimates."

The population estimates and projections are also used to calculate World Bank’s poverty estimates, such as the number of people living in poverty. In addition, they are used to produce population weighted averages for regions and income groups."

In each release, the population estimates are prepared by Development Data Group (DECDG), and reviewed and cleared by country economists of the World Bank through the Operational Guidelines exercise (Spring Survey) in March-May for the July 1st release, and through the Fall Survey in September-November for the December release. The Spring Survey and the Fall Survey are annual data collection and review exercises covering national accounts data for borrower economies with World Bank’s country economists."

    "section": "2.2 Selection criteria",
    "text": "2.2 Selection criteria\nFor NSO population estimates to be used, they must be deemed sufficiently reliable, available as an annal time-series and reasonably consistent with the World Bank’s definition of population and an economy’s territory. A set of criteria was developed on how to determine whether NSO estimates (including Eurostat) or the UN WPP estimates are used. The purpose of developing these criteria is to be guided by data quality when deciding the population source, while being transparent and objective.\n\nReliability: Reliability is measured by:\n\nBirths are registered from civil registration, which is estimated to be at least 90% complete, or from another source, which is estimated to be reliable by the UNSD. Events may be counted when registered, not when they occurred.\nDeaths are registered from civil registration, which is estimated to be at least 90% complete, or from another source which is estimated to be reliable by the UNSD. Events may be counted when registered, not when they occurred.\nStatistics of births, deaths, and migration are applied for time adjustments, or population estimates are sourced annually from a population register.\nA census has been conducted in the past 15 years, or population figures are compiled from administrative registers.\n\nAvailability: NSO’s estimates must be available in annual time series. Note that NSO’s figures must be estimates, not projections. Estimates are based on a baseline population and empirical data on subsequent births, deaths, and migration, while projections are based on a baseline population and future assumptions of births, deaths, and migration. NSO’s annual time series estimates are used as available, supplemented by UNPD in case for earlier years for which NSO’s annual time series estimates are not available.\nDefinition of population: The NSO uses a definition of population that is reasonably consistent with World Bank’s de-facto definition. For example, population estimates should not include nationals who reside outside of the economy.\nDefinition of territory: Exceptions can be made to the criteria in case the World Bank uses a different territorial definition than the UNPD’s territorial definition; and vice versa.\n\nThe reliability criteria 1.1-1.3 use UN Statistics Division’s Population and Vital Statistics Report, and the Demographic Yearbook Metadata as the source, while the reliability criterion 1.4 uses the World Bank’s Statistical Performance Indicators. Two World Bank economies do not figure in the UNSD database: Kosovo and Taiwan. For these economies, the information is gathered from NSO publications. Data for Virgin Islands (U.S.) and Puerto Rico are published by US Census Bureau so the data of the United States are used.\nNSO estimates (including Eurostat) are used when they meet all these criteria, which is roughly one third of all economies in the WDI database. The UN WPP estimates are used for the rest."

    "section": "3.1 UN WPP",
    "text": "3.1 UN WPP\n\n3.1.1 Use July 1 population estimates from the UN WPP\nThe data source of total population for roughly two thirds of all economies in the WDI database is UNPD’s World Population Prospects (UN WPP). The UNPD produces population estimates and projections typically every other year. The UN WPP covers years ranging from 1950 to 2100, and the most recent revision of WPP, which was published in July 2024 (WPP 2024 Revision), contains estimates of population and other demographic indicators for 1950-2023, and projections of them for 2024-2100 for 237 economies (United Nations 2024a). The UN WPP 2024 Revision has annual total population for beginning of year (January 1st) as well as for mid-year (July 1st), and the latter is used as is for the WDI database. Mid-year population is typically more appropriate for representing population figures for the whole year, and also to calculate annual per capita figures such as GDP per capita and GNI per capita as well as other rates, rather than January 1st population.\nIf the WDI needs a population estimate beyond the latest estimates covered by the UN WPP, medium scenario projections of the UN WPP are used. For example, if the WDI needs population estimates for 2024 for its July 2025 release, but the latest WPP estimates are for 2023, then the WPP projections for 2024 are used.\nThe UN WPP takes into account the latest data available, such as censuses, official estimates, demographic surveys, vital event registries, population registries, and other relevant data from NSOs. The UN WPP population estimates are constructed using a cohort-component method, which takes into account the three components of population change – births, deaths and migration – to project the population forward in time (Leslie, 1945; Preston et al., 2001; United Nations 2024b). The estimates for each component are taken from relevant data sources and adjusted for under- (or over-) reporting and under- (or over-) enumeration as needed.\nVirtually all censuses have issues of under- (or over) counts. Ideally, after a census, an economy should conduct a post enumeration survey (PES) to measure the magnitude of under- (or over) counts. Economies can make adjustments subsequently. However, many economies often publish census figures without PES and/or without making such adjustments. Under-count is much more common than over-count because missing people during censuses is much more likely to happen than double-counting people (United Nations 2017). Therefore, such census figures are likely to be under-estimated. The UNPD carries out an analysis that takes into account those issues and seeks to establish past population trends by resolving the inconsistencies (Pelletier 2020, United Nations 2024b).\nAs a result of these adjustments and its methodology, the UN WPP estimates differ from population estimates and census estimates of national statistical offices. These adjustments made in the UN WPP estimates are deemed to reduce potential biases and errors, especially for many low- and middle-income economies, and thus the WDI relies on the UN WPP as the primary source for population estimates for many low- and middle-income economies.\nMid-year population estimates of UN WPP are directly used in the WDI database with one exception: adjustments are made to UN WPP data for WDI’s Channel Islands, for which UN WPP estimates of Guernsey and Jersey are summed up."

Eurostat collects population and other demographic data from NSOs for European Union (EU) member states as well as from select non-EU European states. For those economies that meet the WDI selection criteria and for which the Eurostat collects data regularly, the average population in Eurostat database are used as they are, where the average population is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the population on January 1st of two consecutive years (Eurostat 2024). If there are footnotes in Eurostat’s database indicating notes such as provisional data or break in time series, they are included in the WDI footnotes as well.\n\n\n3.2.2 Missing data\nAlthough the Eurostat database publishes population data from 1960, some economies have missing data for early years such as before 1980s or 1990s. In this case, for missing years, data are taken from NSOs, and used if available. Otherwise, mid-year population data from UN WPP are used.\nFor the latest year, Eurostat publishes average population data around the summer of the subsequent year. Therefore, when mid-year population data are needed for the Operational Guidelines exercise around March, the mid-year/average population data for the latest year needed are not available in Eurostat database. Thus, mid-year (or average) population data are sought from NSO websites of each economy and used if available. If they are not available in the NSO websites, a short extrapolation using the exponential growth rate in the past 6 months is applied to generate a population figure for the latest year temporarily in the July update. The growth rates are calculated from the two most recent data points available in the Eurostat database. The extrapolated figures are replaced with newly available Eurostat data in the subsequent WDI population update cycle."

Links to official NSO websites are available on the UN Statistics Division’s website. NSOs’ population data in time series are searched on the official NSO websites in its databases and publications. If the NSO publishes mid-year (July 1st or June 30th) or average population estimates, the data are taken directly. NSOs often revise/update population estimates, not only for the latest year but also in recent past years. If so, the WDI population estimates are also revised/updated accordingly. If there are footnotes in the NSOs’ database or publications which indicate data are preliminary or there is a break in time series, these notes are included in the WDI footnotes as well.\n\n\n3.3.2 Adjustments for reference time of the year\nSome NSOs publish only end-year (or beginning-of year) population estimates. If this is the case, approximation of mid-year estimates is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the end-year (or beginning-of year) estimates of two consecutive years.\n\n\n3.3.3 Missing data\nSome of the NSOs do not publish time-series population estimates for early years. The missing years range from 1960s to 2000s, depending on the economy. In this case, mid-year population data from UN WPP are used for the missing years.\nIf population data for the latest year(s) are not yet available from the NSO, a short extrapolation (typically 1 year or 6 months) is applied using an exponential growth rate to generate a population figure for the latest year(s) temporarily. The exponential growth rates are calculated from the two most recent population data points available from the NSO.

The medium scenario is most used. The medium scenario projection corresponds to the mean fertility and mortality and median net migration of several thousand distinct trajectories of each demographic component derived using a probabilistic model of the variability in changes over time (United Nations 2024).
